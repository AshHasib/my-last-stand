# My Last Stand

My life as an undergraduate has almost come to an end. Within the remaining time, I want to revise and improve my problem solving skills including data structures & algorithms as a job preparation. That is why I created this repository to store all my last minute works. They maybe text, code or images. The codes may be of different languages. I will update the README file by time and progress of work.
